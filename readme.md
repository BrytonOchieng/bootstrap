What Is Bootstrap?

Remember when we spoke about responsive design? Well, it’s time to meet Bootstrap. It will be your responsive design guide.

How will Bootstrap make your life easier?

Bootstrap code is already written and is available for everyone to use. So, we’ll be treating it like a library and borrow only what we need from it.
Everything we need is already on the Internet. We just have to be selective, thorough, and pick out only what we need. This is called “snippeting”.

Snippeting is basically copying code from another source and pasting it to your code. It is ethical and unproblematic in Bootstrap, no need to worry.

How Is It Used?

We will now look at a few of the many examples of how to use Bootstrap. You can find more information on Bootstrap’s official website. Feel free to try new things!
Like every library, to have access to its elements you must add the following line inside the section of your HTML page:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
